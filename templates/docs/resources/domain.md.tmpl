# openprovider_domain (Resource)

Manages an OpenProvider domain. Supports both domain registration and domain transfer. To transfer a domain, provide an auth_code.

## Example Usage

### Domain Registration

#### Basic

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/simple.tf"}}

#### With Customer Handle

{{tffile "examples/domain/with_customer.tf"}}

#### With NS Group (Recommended)

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/with_ns_group.tf"}}

#### With DS Records (DNSSEC)

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/with_ds_records.tf"}}

#### Full (Legacy Nameservers)

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/full.tf"}}

### Domain Transfer

To transfer a domain, provide an `auth_code` obtained from your current registrar.

#### Basic Transfer

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/transfer_basic.tf"}}

#### Transfer with Import Options

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/transfer_with_import_options.tf"}}

#### Transfer with NS Group

{{tffile "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/transfer_with_nsgroup.tf"}}

## Important Notes

- **Transfer vs Registration**: The resource automatically detects whether to register or transfer based on the presence of `auth_code`. If `auth_code` is provided, a transfer is initiated; otherwise, a new domain is registered.
- **Transfer Process**: Domain transfers typically take 5-7 days to complete. The resource is created once the transfer is initiated (status: `REQ`), not when it completes (status: `ACT`).
- **Auth Code**: The authorization code (EPP code) must be obtained from your current registrar before initiating the transfer. This field is sensitive and should be stored securely.
- **Delete Behavior**: For transfers, destroying this resource removes it from Terraform state only; the domain remains at OpenProvider.

## Import

Import a domain using the domain name.

{{codefile "shell" "examples/resources/openprovider_domain/import.sh"}}

**Note for Transferred Domains**: If the domain was transferred to OpenProvider, you must provide the `auth_code` in your Terraform configuration after import, or the resource will show a diff on the next plan.
